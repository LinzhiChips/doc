Resuming after a shutdown
=========================

The way to resume mining after a shutdown has changed with firmware
fw-test-20210624-0926 and later.

The following table shows the results various actions will produce after
a shutdown:

Action			Clear fault	Reboot		Stop/restart mined (1)
			---------------	---------------	------------------
Old version (2)		stays down	resumes mining	resumes mining
TRIP_MASTER (3) not set	resumes mining	see table below	stays down
TRIP_MASTER is set	stays down	see table below	stays down

SWITCHES_ON_BOOT (3)	Power on	Power off	Restore last
			---------------	---------------	---------------
TRIP_MASTER not set	resumes mining	stays down	resumes mining
TRIP_MASTER is set	resumes mining	stays down	stays down

(1) In System > Daemons
(2) Older than fw-test-20210624-0926
(3) In Configuration > Controller > General

Mined is now stopped after a shutdown. Older versions left it running, and
let it try to operate the powered-down board.


Resume mining after a shutdown
------------------------------

1) Clear the fault. This can be done by clicking on "Clear" or by rebooting
   the miner.

   If TRIP_MASTER is not set, the boards will then power on again and
   resume mining.

2) If TRIP_MASTER is set, go to Power > On/off and switch power back on.
   The boards will then be powered up and resume mining.


Recommended settings
--------------------

The setting of Configuration > Controller > General > SWITCHES_ON_BOOT and
Configuration > Controller > General > TRIP_MASTER determine how aggressively
a miner will try to power up, and how it will react to power failures.

A) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "on", TRIP_MASTER = "only power down until cleared":
   This setting makes the miner mine when unattended, only stop if there is a
   problem, and resume as soon as it is cleared.

   If power fails before the problem is cleared, the miner will resume mining
   when power resumes. This also avoids a miner shutting down if mains power
   failures lead to DCDC shutdowns.

B) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "on", TRIP_MASTER = "turn off master power":
   Like above, but mining only resumes after clearing a fault if the master
   power switch in Power > On/off is turned on again. Note that the miner will
   still resume mining after a power failure, even if the fault has not been
   cleared.

   This setting may be useful for a workflow where faults are routinely cleared
   before examining failed miners.

C) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "last", TRIP_MASTER = "only power down until cleared":
   This gives priority to shutting down miners via Power > On/off, but lets
   it resume after power failures, as described above.

D) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "last", TRIP_MASTER = "turn off master power":
   This ensures that a miner that has shut down will only return to operation
   after someone has had a chance to look at it.

   If power fails while the miner is shut down, it will remain shut down after
   power returns. Power cycling removes the shutdown indication, but any miner
   that is still powered down can be found in the crew by the "OFF" status in
   the flags column. Details of the shutdown may be in the report, in
   System > Reports, if the miner has generated one.

E) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "off", TRIP_MASTER = "only power down until cleared":
   if there is any problem, the miner will shut down and stay down. The miner
   also does not resume after loss of power. This setting is suitable for
   miners that should only run under supervision, e.g., if they are operating
   in an unsafe configuration (lack of cooling, etc.)

F) SWITCHES_ON_BOOT = "off", TRIP_MASTER = "turn off master power": this adds
   the power switch as second confirmation before the miner will resume after
   a shutdown.

Of the above settings, the combinations A, C, D and F should be the most
useful, with the choice among them depending on operational requirements.
