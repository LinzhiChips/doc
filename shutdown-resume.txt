Resuming after a shutdown
=========================

The way to resume mining after a shutdown has changed with firmware
fw-test-20210624-0926 and later. If we have had a shutdown, the
following actions will yield the results in the table:

Action			Clear fault	Reboot		Stop/restart mined (1)
			---------------	---------------	------------------
Old version (2)		stays down	resumes mining	resumes mining
TRIP_MASTER (3) not set	resumes mining	see table below	stays down
TRIP_MASTER is set	stays down	see table below	stays down

SWITCHES_ON_BOOT (3)	Power on	Power off	Restore last
			---------------	---------------	---------------
TRIP_MASTER not set	resumes mining	stays down	resumes mining
TRIP_MASTER is set	resumes mining	stays down	stays down

To resume mining if TRIP_MASTER is set, first clear the fault, then go to
Power > On/off and switch power back on. Switching on power without clearing
the fault may work, but coord, the coordination daemon, may turn power off
again anytime unless the fault is cleared. A reboot clears the fault as well.

(1) In System > Daemons
(2) Older than fw-test-20210624-0926
(3) In Configuration > Controller > General

Furthermore, mined is now stopped after a shutdown. Older versions left it
running, and had it try to operate the powered-down board.
