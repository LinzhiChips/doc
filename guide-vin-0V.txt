Technical guide: some but not all input voltages show 0.000 V
=============================================================

When examining Power > Telemetry, e.g., after a board has generated a DCDC
shutdown and/or has failed to power up, one may see the following pattern:

- "Power in" of one or more channels shows exactly 0.000 V,

- the temperature(s) of the corresponding channel(s) are indicated as 0 C,

- the remaining channel(s) look(s) normal.

The register dump in Power > Dump may show MEM for STATUS_CML (possibly
among other flags.)


Probable cause
--------------

The underlying issue seems to be an I2C communication fault of one or more
of the voltage regulators on the hashboard, which causes the regulator to
enter this state.


Manual recovery
---------------

This is a "soft" problem. Power-cycling the power supply, and thus the
regulator, normally resolves the problem.


Possible prevention
-------------------

This type of problem only appeared with sufficient frequency to be noticed
after we used frequent polling of the power status of the regulators, by
setting Configuration > Controller > General > POWER_POLL_INTERVAL to a low
value.

We expect that disabling power polling (by setting the interval to 0) or
choosing a large value (e.g., 300 seconds) should greatly reduce the
frequency of such faults, and possibly avoid them entirely.


Automatic recovery
------------------

The normal "clear fault" procedure does not work in this case. We are
currently investigating alternative ways to clear this fault.
