Technical guide: uSD space for the DAG cache
============================================

A miner may run out of space and then fail to cache multiple DAG files. This
guide describes the symptoms, discusses how space is allocated, and provides
work-arounds for space shortage.


Symptoms
--------

When the miner runs low on uSD space, it reduces the number of DAG files it
caches. If the available space is not sufficient for two or more files, the
miner is unable to pre-compute DAGs for future epochs, and needs to compute
the next DAG at the epoch change, delaying mining in the new epoch by several
hours.


Space allocation
----------------

Firmware versions >= fw-rd-20210107-0600 calculate the available space for
DAGs as follows: the total capacity of the uSD card minus 6 GB (where 1 GB
is 2^30 bytes).

The 6 GB are reserved for:
- the firmware,
- firmware updates (during an update, both the old and the new firmware are
  temporarily stored on the card),
- the checksum files,
- cached data, such as MBIST (memory test) results,
- reports,
- any files needed for customization of the boot/setup process, and
- anything we may add in the future.


32 GB cards
-----------

On 32 GB cards (or larger), the above space allocation leaves plenty of room,
and running out of space should not be a concern.


16 GB cards
-----------

A card with a nominal capacity of 16 GB may have 15549952 kilobytes of actually
usable capacity. Minus the reserve of 6297600 kB, this leaves 9252352 kB, or
room for two DAGs of 4.412 GB each. The usable capacity may vary among cards.

Ethereum DAGs have grown beyond this limit and are currently around 4.43 GB.

The DAGs of other coins mineable by our miners are smaller, and there should
be sufficient room to store the DAGs of multiple epochs.


Moving to a larger card
-----------------------

One way to solve the space limitation is to replace 16 GB cards with larger
cards. To do so, extract fw-...-full.tar to the root directory of an empty
VFAT-formatted uSD card, then replace the card and press RESET.


Reducing the reservation
------------------------

If there is unused space on a 16 GB card, the reservation can be reduced
accordingly. With firmware >= fw-test-20210907-1735, this can be done by
setting Configuration > Controller > Mining > RESERVED_SPACE to a value lower
than 6G (bytes), e.g., to 3 GB. Then either reboot, or restart dagd (1).

To calculate how much space is currently occupied by non-DAG data, SSH (2) to
the miner, then

~# cd /data
~# /data# du -s .
~# /data# du -s dag

The difference between the first and the second number is the space occupied
by firmware, etc., in kilobytes. This, plus a margin of 100 MB for temporary
files created during firmware updates, would be the absolute minimum space
that must be reserved.

If the occupied space is larger than 2 GB or if the total card capacity seems
very low, the card should be reformatted/replaced, and new firmware installed
on it. (See "Moving to a larger card".)

(1) To restart dagd, click on System > Daemons > dagd, then on "Stop" below
    the log window that opens, then finally "Start" and "Close".

(2) Shell access vis SSH can be set up in Configuration > Account. A reboot is
    required after creating/changing an account.
