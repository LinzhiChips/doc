Technical guide: preparing for zombie-mining (Ethereum)
=======================================================

Epoch 440 of Ethereum (ETH) is expected [1] to begin on 2021-09-09 UTC or
2021-09-10 UTC. Starting with epoch 440, the DAG will no longer fit in the
memory of our miners.

A mode called "zombie-mining" will then activate, which will allow the
miners to continue mining, but at a reduced hashrate. The miners will get
slower with every epoch, until it will be more profitable to mine other coins.
E.g., regularly mining Ethereum Classic (ETC) should yield better profits than
zombie-mining ETH after the end of September.

Technical details of zombie-mining can be found in [2].


Firmware for zombie-mining
--------------------------

Zombie mining is supported in firmware >= fw-rd-20210808-0031
Using a version >= fw-rd-20210828-0106 is recommended.

Miners mining ETC, UBQ, or other coins will not need support for zombie-mining
until at least the year 2022 (most coins much later, if there are no changes
to algorithm, block rate, etc.)


Checksum files
--------------

Firmware >= fw-rd-20210808-0031 also includes additional checksum files for
ETH. Checksum files are used to validate pre-calculated DAGs stored on the uSD
card (which takes less than 15 minutes).

If there is no checksum file for the DAG of a given epoch, the DAG is
re-calculated, which takes several hours, 

The update process for checksum files consists of two steps:

1) Installation of a firmware that supports updating checksum files, and

2) installation of a firmware that includes the new checksum files.

If upgrading through the Web UI or MQTT, this typically requires the same
firmware to be installed twice: first to obtain the checksum file installation
capability, and the second time to make use of it and install the checksum
files.

For the first step (if necessary), either the fw-...-full or the non-full
version can be used. For the second step, only the fw-...-full version is
suitable (the non-full version does not contain any checksum files.)

If extracting the firmware fw-...-full.tar file directly onto the uSD card, no
second step is required.

The version of the checksum files is shown in System > Firmware > Checksums
version, under "PL". The correct version is >= 2. If no checksums version is
shown, then the firmware is too old and needs to be updated.

The checksums version is also shown in the crew, column "Checksums".

Note that, if upgrading from a firmware version < fw-rd-20210828-0106, working
around the memory leak discussed in [3] may be necessary before the upgrade can
be performed.
