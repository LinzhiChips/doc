Technical guide: computing DAGs on a PC
=======================================

DAG computation on a Phoenix is fairly slow, taking several hours. A PC can
do it in much less time, and the resulting files can then be copied to the
miner. This guide explains how to do this with a Linux PC. (May work with
other types of Unix as well.)


Setting up the Linux PC
-----------------------

- Obtain the code for the DAG daemon and the libraries it uses:

  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/libcommon.git
  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/libdag.git
  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/dagd.git

- Build libraries and daemon:

  make -C libcommon
  make -C libdag
  make -C dagd


Generating DAG files
--------------------

Choose which DAG algorithm to use (etchash, ethash, or ubqhash), and which
epochs, then run:

  dagd/precompute-dags algorithm first-epoch last-epoch

For example,

  dagd/precompute-dags etchash 240 240

This example creates a DAG file called etchash-240.dag, which can then be
used on the miner. If a DAG is larger than 4 GB, a second file
ALGORITHM-NNN.dag-1 is made, which also needs to be copied to the miner.

As a reference, computing the epoch 240 etchash DAG on an i7-7700K takes
about 18 minutes, over 4.5 hours on a Phoenix.


Uploading the DAG to the miner
------------------------------

- If not done already, set up SSH access to the miner in
  Configuration > Account (needs a reboot to become effective)

- Stop dagd (System > Daemons > dagd, Stop)

- Run

  scp etchash-*.dag* miner:/data

- Start dagd


Copying the DAG directly to a uSD card
--------------------------------------

- Mount the miner's uSD card on your Linux PC and copy the *.dag* files to
  the dag/ directory of the card.

- Insert the uSD card into the miner and reboot.
