Dual-mining ETC+ZIL
===================

Firmware starting with version fw-test-20221012-0128 supports dual mining of
ETC and Zilliqa (ZIL). In such a configuration, the miner mines ZIL during a
one-minute window every hour, and it mines ETC for the rest of the time.

Dual mining can be implemented either through miners connecting to two pools
and switching among them, or through miners connecting to a single pool that
switches between both coins, typically proxying one of the coins to another
pool. We support the latter approach.


Setting up ETC+ZIL mining
-------------------------

1. Install firmware with Zillqa (ZIL) mining support.

2. Stop dagd and mined(s) in System > Daemons

3. Set Configuration > Controller > Mining > ZILLIQA_SUPPORT to "Support
   Zilliqa mining"

4. Restart dagd and mined(s) in System > Daemons

   In the user interface, a progress bar for only one DAG will appear. When
   finished, the progress bar disappears and the cached ETC DAGs are shown.

   Generating the ZIL DAG should take about 80 minutes. The DAG file is stored
   in /data/dag/zil-ethash-0.dag
   (This is simply an ETH/ETC epoch 0 DAG.)

5. Optional: set up logging of mined output:

   - If Configuration > Controller > Mining > SEPARATE_MINED is set to
     "Single mined operates both boards":

     mosquitto_sub -h your-miner -t /daemon/mined/log >file

   - Else:

     mosquitto_sub -v -h your-miner -t /daemon/mined0/log \
       -t /daemon/mined1/log >file

6. Configure a pool in Configuration > Pool

   Templates for Crazypool (ETC) via Rustpool (ZIL and proxy) and Crazypool
   via ShardPool are available under the ETC+ZIL tab of the wizard.

   Example:

   etc.stratum0://0xb54343d8ddddc1b8998e6bbc17d07c9ec9768fc4.3c47:zil1awhgz8c67dda8rtuz9df7jvaa4wvzgxl3xhv8t@us.crazypool.org:7000@us1-zil.shardpool.io:3333

   The components:

   - etc: the principal coin we're mining

   - stratum0: the ZIL pool uses the EtherProxy protocol

   - 0xb543...: the ETC wallet

   - 3c47: the machine name

   - zil1a...: the ZIL wallet

   - us.crazypool.org:7000: the ETC pool (can be any ETC pool that speaks
     EtherProxy)

   - us1-zil.shardpool.io:3333: the ZIL pool, with proxy to the Ethash-type
     pool

7. In Configuration > Pool, deactivate any other destinations, hover right of
   the checkbox of the ETC+ZIL entry, and click the red arrow.

The miner will now switch to mining ZIL for about one minute roughly every
hour, and mine ETC the rest of the time. While mining ZIL, the "Mining:"
indication under the per-slot progress bars on the status page of the Web UI
changes to "epoch ?  (?, ?)"

A detailed timeline of dual-mining events and statistics can be found in
System > Dual-mining.


Disabling ETC+ZIL mining
------------------------

While it should normally be sufficient to just select a different pool
destination to return to ETC-only mining, having support for ETC+ZIL active
still

- consumes about 1 GB on the uSD card,

- the cached DAG for ZIL is checked each time the miner reboots, and

- the ZIL DAG is loaded into the ASICs.

ZIL support can be partially deactivated (the DAG is no longer checked or
loaded, and mined operates normally) by setting
Configuration > Controller > Mining > ZILLIQA_SUPPORT to 
"Leave (room for) the DAG but don't recognize ZIL jobs"

This keeps the DAG file, so that one can quickly return to mining ZIL.

To also remove the cached DAG, set ZILLIQA_SUPPORT to "Do not support Zilliqa".


Coin + ZIL pairings
-------------------

The ETC+ZIL pairing should be minable on Phoenixes until approximately
2023-10 (according to the DAG growth projection of minerstats.)

An alternative could be UBQ+ZIL (not tested), which should be minable for much
longer. However, Ubiq's daily total mining rewards are only about USD 200
(2022-09-29).

EXP+ZIL might also be a possibility, but the daily total rewards are even
smaller, and there are plans to change Expanse's PoW algorithm to something a
Phoenix could not mine.

Coins with too large a DAG for dual-mining with ZIL on a Phoenix include ETHW,
ETHF, QKC, and CLO.
