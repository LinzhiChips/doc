ETH -> ETC transition
=====================

The current firmware has a bug that can cause dagd to fail if switching
coins. These instructions take this into account.

Furthermore, they indicate where an already computed DAG can be used (if
one is available), to speed up the transition.

- Check on crazypool which DAG to use (epoch and when the next change is
  due):

- Make sure there's enough space on the uSD card (we need a bit less than
  3 GB).
  If there is not enough space:
  - Kill dagd (and leave it dead until the switch is complete)
  - Use ssh (create an account in Configuration > Account if necessary) to
    login to the miner and remove the highest-numbered DAG in /data/dag.
    E.g., cd /data/dag; rm ethash-416.dag*

- If you already have a suitable ETC DAG file on another ETC miner:
  - Copy the ETC DAG from the ETC miner's /data/dag/ to the ETH miner
    (should take less than 15 minutes)
  If you don't have a suitable ETC DAG yet, the miner will create it.
  This takes about 3.5 hours.

- Configure ETC pool(s):
  - Add pool URLs either manually or with the wizard
  - Click the checkboxes to disable automatic selection (we don't want the 
    miner to perform an unintended switch, since this may cause dagd to
    fail and even if it works, the miner would spend hours computing the
    new DAG)

- Kill dagd (if not already dead)
- Switch from ETH pool to ETC pool(s):
  - Disable automatic selection of all ETH pools
  - Enable automatic selection of all ETC pools
  - Select one of the ETC pools by clicking the red triangle (appears when
    hovering) next to it
  - Confirm that you really want to switch coins

- Start dagd

- dagd will first verify the new DAG, then mined will set up the ASICs and
  mining starts. dagd will continue to pre-compute more DAGs, and consume
  the cached ETH DAGs to make room.
