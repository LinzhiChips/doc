Technical guide: fingerprinting
===============================

Starting with firmware fw-rd-20211220-2243, fingerprints of individual ASICs
can be obtained. This guide describes how to retrieve them.


Fingerprints
------------

The fingerprints of all the dies of a hashboard can be obtained with
Diagnostics > Fingerprints (stop the mining daemon first, preferably with
Power > On/Off)


Bulk collection of fingerprints
-------------------------------

The script bulk-fingerprints in https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools
takes a list of miners from the command line or from a file, and then retrieves
the fingerprints of the boards in all of them.

Since the boards need to be power-cycled for this. bulk-fingerprints stops the
mining daemons, and restarts them after collecting the fingerprints.

Fingerprints are printed on standard output in the format
board/die=fingerprint
where "board" is the serial number of the respective hashboard, "die" is the
die number (0 to 63), and "fingerprint" are the 256 hex digits of the
fingerprint.

Details on using bulk-fingerprints can be found in
https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools/README


Example
-------

- Install or update farm-tools:

  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools.git

  or

  cd farm-tools
  git pull
  cd ..

- Generate a list of miners (see sections "Machine lists" and "list-miners" in
  https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools/blob/master/README)
  We assume the file with the list of miners is called miners.list

- Collect the fingerprints from all miners:

  farm-tools/bulk-fingerprints miners.list >my.fingerprints


Uses of fingerprints
--------------------

At Linzhi, we use fingerprints to identify and track individual chips, mainly
during testing and manufacturing processes.
