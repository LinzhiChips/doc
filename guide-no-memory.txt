Technical guide: overcoming an out-of-memory condition
======================================================

A miner may run out of memory. We observed this mainly when trying to update
the firmware, and after the miner has been mining for a while.


Symptoms
--------

Diagnostics > dmesg (in firmware >= fw-test-20210806-1024) will show various
statistics and complaints, including a line like this towards the end:

Out of memory: Killed process ... (...) total-vm:...

If the out-of-memory condition is triggered by an attempted firmware update,
no response to the update attempt is shown on System > Firmware.

Furthermore, the firmware update daemon (fwupdated) will have died. This is
indicated with "Stopped" in System > Daemons > fwupdated


Cause
-----

The main reason for running out of memory is a memory leak in the mining
daemon. This is fixed in firmware versions >= fw-rd-20210828-0106


Recovery (user interface)
-------------------------

To free memory on a miner that has experienced an out-of-memory condition, it
is often sufficient to stop the mining daemon:

- Click on System > Daemons > mined
- Click on the "Stop" button below the log window that then opens

Then restart the firmware update daemon:

- System > Daemons > fwupdated
- "Start"

Alternatively, the miner can be rebooted. Since reboots are handled by
fwupdated, it needs to be restarted first (see above). Then reboot with
System > Firmware > Reboot

If in the process of updating the firmware, you can then proceed as usual.

If no reboot or update is planned, and mined is still stopped, restart it with
System > Daemons > mined, then "Start".


Recovery (script)
-----------------

If a large number of miners has run out of memory, or you want to make sure
they're ready for a firmware update, first

  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools.git

and read the README. Make a list of miners that need to be recovered, then

  ./bulk-config /daemon/mined/stop=1 miners.list
  ./bulk-config /daemon/fwupdated/start=1 miners.list

to make the update:

  ./push-update fw-...tar miners.list
