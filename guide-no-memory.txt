Technical guide: overcoming an out-of-memory condition
======================================================

A miner may run out of memory (controller RAM, not DAG memory). We observed
this mainly when trying to update the firmware, and after the miner has been
mining for a while.


Symptoms
--------

Diagnostics > dmesg (in firmware >= fw-test-20210806-1024) will show various
statistics and complaints, including a line like this towards the end:

Out of memory: Killed process ... (...) total-vm:...

If the out-of-memory condition is triggered by an attempted firmware update,
no response to the update attempt is shown on System > Firmware.

Furthermore, the firmware update daemon (fwupdated) will have died. This is
indicated with "Stopped" in System > Daemons > fwupdated

Further symptoms may include:

- The MQTT broker (mosquitto) is killed, interrupting all monitoring and
  control over MQTT (and the Web UI.) SSH, if enabled, still works.

- The crew daemon (crewd) is killed. The miner will then show as "SILENT" in
  the crew.


Cause
-----

The main reason for running out of memory is a memory leak in the mining
daemon. This is fixed in firmware versions >= fw-rd-20210828-0106

With fw-rd-20211004-0038, we also observed miners running out of memory when
attempting a firmware update. The cause for this is still under investigation.


Prevention
----------

Rebooting a miner shortly before performing a firmware update seems to be a
reliable way to avoid out-of-memory problems. A group of miners can be rebooted
with the bulk-config script from farm-tools:

  ./bulk-config -w 60 /fw/update=reboot miners.list

Restarting the mining daemon, as described in the recovery sections below,
should also prevent out-of-memory problems.


Recovery (user interface)
-------------------------

To free memory on a miner that has experienced an out-of-memory condition but
is still responsive, it is often sufficient to stop the mining daemon:

- Click on System > Daemons > mined
- Click on the "Stop" button below the log window that then opens

Then restart the firmware update daemon:

- System > Daemons > fwupdated
- "Start"

Alternatively, the miner can be rebooted. Since reboots are handled by
fwupdated, it needs to be restarted first (see above). Then reboot with
System > Firmware > Reboot

If in the process of updating the firmware, you can then proceed as usual.

If no reboot or update is planned, and mined is still stopped, restart it with
System > Daemons > mined, then "Start".


Recovery (script)
-----------------

If a large number of miners has run out of memory, or you want to make sure
they're ready for a firmware update, first

  git clone https://github.com/LinzhiChips/farm-tools.git

and read the README. Make a list of miners that need to be recovered, then

  ./bulk-config /daemon/mined/stop=1 miners.list
  ./bulk-config /daemon/fwupdated/start=1 miners.list

to make the update:

  ./push-update fw-...tar miners.list


Recovery (if all else fails)
----------------------------

If a miner no longer responds to MQTT but still accepts SSH, running
/sbin/reboot -f
will restore normal operation.

If an out-of-memory condition has rendered a miner completely unresponsive,
and also SSH is not available, pressing the reset button will bring it back to
life. (Unless there are other issues, not related to running out of memory.)

In case an out-of-memory problem keeps on preventing firmware updates, the
firmware can also be updated by using a PC and extracting the fw-...tar on the
uSD card of the miner, or by extracting fw-...-full.tar on a fresh uSD card.
